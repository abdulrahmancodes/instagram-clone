# instagram-clone

The project was built using react.js, Firebase and TailwindCSS. The UI of the application is identical to the real Instagram. 

The multi-page application has seven different pages: login, signup, dashboard, profile, not-found, suggested-users page and a create-post page. Some of these pages are public  and some are private. 

Currently, the application has following features :

Users can 
1. login/signup with email
2. follow each other
3. upload photos with captions 
4. like, comment and save the posts

The project is still under development.
